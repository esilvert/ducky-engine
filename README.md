# Ducky Engine

## How to use
1. Start with an empty DragonRuby app (find it [here](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk)).
2. Clone Ducky Engine in your app

     git submodule add git@github.com:esilvert/ducky-engine.git ducky

  :warning: The folder containing the engine should be named `ducky`, not `ducky-engine`

3. Into the new `ducky` folder, you will find a Makefile to install it. Run:

    cd ducky && make install
